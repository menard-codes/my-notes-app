There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris. (Larry Wall) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous)

    There are only two industries that refer to their customers as ‘users’. (Edward Tufte) The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. (Randall E. Stross) The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry. (Henry Petroski) I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon)
    
    If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. (Robert Sewell) There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses. (Bjarne Stroustrup) Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. (Ralph Johnson) To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. (Paul Ehrlich)
    
    Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding) In software, we rarely have meaningful requirements. Even if we do, the only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the customer’s shifting idea of what their problem is. (Jeff Atwood) True innovation often comes from the small startup who is lean enough to launch a market but lacks the heft to own it. (Timm Martin) No matter h{ if (window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ {;window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ line: 39, reset: true }); line: 39 })) break; ow slick the demo is in rehearsal, when you do it in front of a live audience, the probability of a flawless presentation is inversely proportional to the number of people watching, raised to the power of the amount of money involved. (Mark Gibbs)
    
    C++ : Where friends have access to your private members. (Gavin Russell Baker) We will never become a truly paper-less society until the Palm Pilot folks come out with WipeMe 1.0.

    Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing. (Gerald Weinberg) Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment. (Kent Beck) Computers are like bikinis. They save people a lot of guesswork. (Sam Ewing) We will never become a truly paper-less society until the Palm Pilot folks come out with WipeMe 1.0. (Andy Pierson) I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal)
    
    The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state. (J. Osterhout) One man’s crappy software is another man’s full-time job. (Jessica Gaston) Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. (Ralph Johnson) Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots. So far the Universe is winning. (Rich Cook)
    
    The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time. (Tom Cargill) Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to think out every case. (Francis Glassborow) It’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature. (Anonymous) You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy) Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.

    Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. (Eagleson’s Law) There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. (C.A.R.

(Anonymous) Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots. So far the Universe is winning. (Rich Cook) Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. (Michael Sinz) Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right.
